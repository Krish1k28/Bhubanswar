<hr>
<p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhubaneswar">Bhubaneswar</a> (Odia: [ˈbʱubɔneswɔɾɔ] ⓘ) <Strong>is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Odisha, located in the Khordha district</Strong>. <i>The region, especially the old town, was historically often depicted as Chakra Kshetra</i> and Ekamra Kshetra (Area adorned with a mango tree).[9] Bhubaneswar is dubbed the "Temple City", a nickname earned because of the 700 temples which once stood there.[10][11] In contemporary times, it has emerged as an education hub[12][13] and an attractive business destination.[14][15][16]

    Although the modern city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhubaneswar">Bhubaneswar</a> was formally established in 1948, the history of the areas in and around the present-day city can be traced to the 7th century BCE and earlier. It is a confluence of Hindu, Buddhist and Jain heritage and includes several Kalingan temples, many of them from 6th–13th century CE. With Puri and Konark it forms the " <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhubaneswar">Swarna Tribhuja</a> " (lit. 'Golden Triangle'), one of Eastern India's most visited destinations.[17][18]

The modern city was designed by the German architect Otto Königsberger in 1946. Along with Jamshedpur and Chandigarh, it was one of modern India's first planned cities.[19] Bhubaneswar and Cuttack are often referred to as the 'twin cities of Odisha'. The metropolitan area formed by the two cities had a population of 1.7 million in 2011.[20] The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhubaneswar">Bhubaneswar</a> metro area has a population of around a million people, and is categorised as a Tier-2 city.[6] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhubaneswar">Bhubaneswar</a> and Rourkela are the two cities in smart city mission from Odisha.Etomology
